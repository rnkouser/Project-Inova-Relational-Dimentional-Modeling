# Inova Automobile Case Study

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive data management and analytics solution for Inova Automobile, addressing the current operational challenges and supporting the organization's growth and market expansion.

## Background
A recent policy introduced by the prime minister, which promotes Canadian-made products and offers incentives to the manufacturing sector, has resulted in a surge in demand for Inova auto spare parts across North America. Initially, Inova Automobile focused on producing spare parts for Ford vehicles such as gears, steering wheels, rear lights, and bumpers for models like the F-150, Ford Explorer, and Ford Edge, all at a production facility located in Alberta.

## Project Scope
To capitalize on these new incentives, the management has decided to:
- Expand production beyond Ford products.
- Set up 10 new plants across 10 different provinces in Canada.
- Expand the market reach to countries in Asia and Africa.

## Current Challenges
1. The sales department maintains limited sales and customer data on Excel sheets.
2. The production department lacks updated information aligning production quantities with warehouse deliveries.
3. The production department does not track product deficiencies or damages.
4. The production department does not monitor staff shifts, overtime, and allowances.
5. The logistics department only handles shipment details and driver information, without tracking the number of products delivered via various transport modes (air, land, road).

## Approved Budget
The management has sanctioned a budget to develop custom software to streamline daily operations, address the existing challenges, and create a unified software platform across the organization to support growth.

## Deliverables
As a data modeler, it is expected to devise an effective strategy to deliver the required solutions for the custom software. Additionally, the management plans to implement an analytics solution as the second phase of IT projects to answer the following questions:
1. What revenue is generated from Ford Explorer spare parts in the Canadian market?
2. What are the most produced spare parts at the Edmonton plant?
3. Which spare parts had the highest demand in 2010 in Africa?
4. Which city globally has the highest demand for Ford Edge?
5. Which plant achieves the highest production capacity with the fewest employees?
6. What are the percentages of product deficiencies, damages, and high-quality products in 2012?
7. Which employees have been most engaged in the production of Ford Edge over the years in each country?
8. What is the total quantity shipped out from Canadian plants by road in 2015?
9. How much have Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo spent on parts over the years?

## Strategy
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregate data from the sales, production, and logistics departments.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and structure the collected data for analysis.
3. **Data Modeling**: Create data models to address the management's queries.
4. **Software Development**: Develop custom software to address the operational challenges.
5. **Analytics Solution**: Implement an analytics solution to generate insights and reports.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance the operational efficiency of Inova Automobile and expand its market reach by developing a comprehensive data management and analytics solution.
